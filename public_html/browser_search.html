                    The internet was open to the world, but the problem was that it was too difficult to get around and even more difficult to find relevant web pages.
                    In 1991 Tim Bernards Lee from Cern invented HTTP and HTML which facilitated the use of web pages and web servers and the world wide web was born. Now you could follow links to get around the internet.

                    Mark Andresent in 1993 at the University of Illinois he developed the Mosaic browser, later renamed the Netscape browser. Mosaic was the first easy to use browser that made the internet more navigable and useful.
                    Netscape browsers went viral on the internet. After Netscape was released the internet grew by 341,000%

                    In 1994 Bill Gates realized that it was a blunder to have ignored the internet and called for a All Hands On Deck to crush Netscape.

                    <p>
                    Thomas Rearden of  Microsoft called Netscape to see if they would make a deal, but “was told to pound sand”.
                    Microsoft eventually was able to arrange a closed-door face to face meeting with Nescape. Neither side agrees on what was said at that meeting, but no deal was reached.
                    Mark Andresent was arrogant and mocked Microsoft, which angered Gates and the Internet Explorer team and made them determined to crush Netscape.

                    In 1995 Microsoft released IE and included it as part of Windows 95.
                    IE continually gained ground on Netscape, largely because IE was included in every copy of Windows, and Microsoft forbid any PC manufacturer from including any other browser.
                    In 1997 IE 4 overtook Netscape and never looked back.
                    In 1998 a monopoly Law Suit was filed against Microsoft for their total dominance in OSs which were packaged with Microsoft's browser, email and other software, and for forcing all computer companies from including competing software. The verdict said that MS should be split, but on appeal they removed that condition. It was a long and arduous trial which took a toll on Gates.

                    Browsers were a big step forward on the internet, however, it was still difficult to find anything.
                    In 1994  David Filo and Jerry Yang founded Yahoo and released the website in 1995. It started out as a manually compiled list of websites which were categorized by their content. It was a great leap forward in searching and Yahoo grew very fast.
                    Soon after Yahoo came Excite search engine later in 1995. Excite was the first exclusively software driven search engine. In 1997 Excite was the 6th most visited website on the internet and 4th by 2000.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Yahoo and Excite and other popular search engines of the day weren't very good at finding relevant information. They returned any site that matched the search term, and were heavily biased toward sites that paid them.
                    In 1996 Larry Page and Sergey Brin students at Stanford University came up with a new search algorithm which counted how many other sites had links to a particular site as well as how many times a site was visited. Sites with high numbers of links and visits were put at the top of the list. They went to many internet companies and venture capitalists to try to sell their product but no one was interested.
                    Vinod Khosla, a venture Capitalist and investor in Excite, tried to get Excite to buy or license googles technology. He set up a meeting between Excite's chief technologist Graham Spenser and Larry and Sergay but he couldn't convince Excite to buy.

                    No one else in silicon valley was interested in google, so in 1998 Larry Page and Sergey Brin students at Stanford University launched google.com on the universities network. Almost immediately google's popularity rose so high that it almost took down Stanford's network and they were forced to move there servers off of the campus.
                    Google's popularity attracted lot's of investment $ even though google refused to advertise and did not have a way of making money.
                    Bill Gross, from GoTo.com, came up with the money making advertising solution that google used. Along with the search results, they included paid results in a separate section off to the side. The paid results were just text with a link, nothing flashy. They did a survey of their customers and it was a success. Google's popularity grew fast, as did the value of the company. **
                    In 2004 Google had their IPO and in 2005 google was valued at $52 billion.

                Bill Gates underestimated the importance of the internet, and therefore was late to start developing a browser. He ruthlessly used his effective monopoly on operating systems for PCs and his power over computer manufactures to gain back that ground and eventually gain superiority.

                Larry Page and Sergey Brim had figured out a better way to search the internet that would revolutionize the search engine industry. However, they couldn't get anyone to take them serious. Many venture capitolists passed them over, and surely have regretted that decision for the rest of their lives. Google quickly took over the search engine battle and never looked back.
