                    In the early days of computers, computers were not envisioned to communicate. They were thought to be standalone systems.
                    J. C. R. Licklider changed this. He envisioned the seminal ideas behind the internet in the 1950s, long before it was technically possible. His vision foretold of graphical computing, point-and-click interfaces, digital libraries, e-commerce, online banking, networked computers with easy user interfaces. These were bold ideas, but it would be years before computers were advanced enough to realize these dreams.
                    Licklider joined ARPA in 1962.

                    <p>Lenard Kleinrock - MIT – Adapted Queuing theory to electronic messages and used Demand Access and Distributed Control in his design. He received the National Medal of Honor for his work.</p>
                    <p>Donald Davies, was a Welsh computer scientist who was employed at the UK National Physical Laboratory who in 1965 he conceived of packet switching.</p>
                    <p>Around the same time Paul Baran – a researcher at RAND, took on the task of designing a "survivable" communications system. He conceived of a robust communications network using “redundancy” and “digital” technology. Paul invented packet switching techniques that played a key role in the development of the internet.</p>

                The history of the Internet has its origin in the efforts to build and interconnect computer networks that arose from research and development in the United States and involved international collaboration, particularly with researchers in the United Kingdom and France.

                Early packet switching networks such as the NPL network, ARPANET, Merit Network, and CYCLADES researched and provided data networking in the early 1970s. ARPA projects and international working groups led to the development of protocols for internetworking, in which multiple separate networks could be joined into a network of networks, which produced various standards. Bob Kahn, at ARPA, and Vint Cerf, at Stanford University, published research in 1974 that evolved into the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), the two protocols of the Internet protocol suite. The design included concepts from the French CYCLADES project directed by Louis Pouzin.[9]

                In the early 1980s, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded national supercomputing centers at several universities in the United States, and provided interconnectivity in 1986 with the NSFNET project, thus creating network access to these supercomputer sites for research and academic organizations in the United States. International connections to NSFNET, the emergence of architecture such as the Domain Name System, and the adoption of TCP/IP internationally on existing networks marked the beginnings of the Internet.
