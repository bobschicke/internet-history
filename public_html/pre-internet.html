                    In the early days of computers, computers were not envisioned to communicate. They were thought to be standalone systems.
                    J. C. R. Licklider changed this. He envisioned the seminal ideas behind the internet in the 1950s, long before it was technically possible. His vision foretold of graphical computing, point-and-click interfaces, digital libraries, e-commerce, online banking, networked computers with easy user interfaces. These were bold ideas, but it would be years before computers were advanced enough to realize these dreams.
                    Licklider joined ARPA in 1962.

                    <p>In 1957 soviets launched Sputnik, which showed their technical superiority.
                       This scared President Eisenhower. To catch up, president Eisenhower created ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) in 1958. The purpose of ARPA was to form and execute research and development projects which would expand the frontiers of science and push the military technologies far into the future. After NASA was created, ARPA was able to focus on defense, an important part of which was retaliation. They needed a decentralized extended network that could survive a bombing attack.</p>
                    <p>Telephone system used centralized hard connections, which could easily be disabled by a bomb taking out a key switch-point. Without communications the United States could not retaliate.</p>

                Licklider was born on March 11, 1915, in St. Louis, Missouri. He studied at Washington University in St. Louis where he graduated with a triple major in physics, mathematics and psychology and went on to his doctorate. He became a research fellow at MIT in 1943 and in 1950 he became interested in information technology. He had ideas about graphical point and click interfaces, digital libraries, e-commerce and online banking. He learned about time-sharing at a conference in Paris, and developed his own version of time-sharing. In 1962 Licklider joined ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) as head of the Information Processing Techniques Office. His work at ARPA included conceiving of and funding network research. While at IPTO, he convinced some of the most important players in the development of the internet, Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and Larry Roberts, that an all-encompassing computer network was very important.
