                    Pylint is a static code checker for python that checks for errors, shows when you stray from a coding standard and looks for code “smells”. A “code smell” is something that “seems” wrong, such as a method that's too long or doesn't have any methods. This is basically a warning that needs to be looked into, however, most times what smells wrong is wrong.

                    The default standard that Pylint checks the code to is PEP8.
                    Some common errors in Pylint are “line-too-long” which means that the line length threshold has been exceeded, “trailing-whitespace” which means there are spaces at the end of a line, “len-as-condition” which means that you shouldn't use “if len(x) > 0:”, you should use “if x:”.
                    Pylint will let you know if you don't have comments in your files, classes and methods.

                    Pylint errors and warnings are very descriptive and point you to the file, line number and column number. It really couldn't get any easier. That said, sometimes pylint gives warnings for things you are doing on purpose. The answer to that is to add a directive to disable the warning. For example, if you want to disable the warning for a line that is too long, simply add this command before the offending code: # pylint: disable=line-too-long

                    <p>
                        <b>Factory:</b> A Factory Design Pattern is a way to design your code so that objects are created without exposing the logic to the client. A factory method can create multiple types of objects. It takes an input, and based on the input it creates a type of object.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Instantiation:</b> Instantiation is the creation of an object by calling its constructor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Object:</b> An object is an instance of a class. The object has its own copy of the class properties and methods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Class:</b> A class is a container for properties and methods. Class methods and properties may be accessed by an object of that class.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Namespace:</b> Namespace is the scope of a property or method.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Constructor:</b> A constructor is the method that instantiates an object.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Fixture:</b> A fixture is a method that can be passed to a test method to setup the conditions for the test.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Type hint:</b> A type hint specifies the type of a variable or the return type of a method. Below, str specifies the type of name as a string, and “→ str” specifies the return type as a string.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Type cast:</b> A type cast converts a variable of one type to another type.
                        “str(456) will convert the integer 456 to a string.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Unit test:</b> unittest is a module in python's library which contains tools for testing your code. Unit testing involves creating a test function which calls the application method, passes parameters if appropriate, and tests that the return value is correct.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Static:</b> A static method in python is a method that can be called without creating an object. Static methods are good for utility functions. They are totally self-contained and only work with data passed in as arguments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Class method:</b> A class method in python can also be called without creating an object. Class methods are methods that are related to a class and have access to all class-specific data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Facade:</b> Facade Design Pattern provides a high level interface that multiple subsystems can use. The Facade hides complexity of the system and provides a simple interface to to the client.
                        Calculator class is a facade for calculations. Calculator wraps calculations class.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Design Patterns:</b>
                        <div><b>Factory Pattern:</b> Allows you to create objects without first specifying what type of object you are creating. The Factory Method will create the appropriate object.</div>
                        <p><b>Builder Pattern:</b> Requires you to builds a complex object by using a step by step approach. A Builder interface defines the steps to build the final object.</p>
                        <p><b>Abstract Factory Pattern:</b> The abstract factory pattern is used to provide a client with a set of related or dependant objects. The "family" of objects created by the factory are determined at run-time.</p>
                        <p><b>Prototype Pattern:</b> Create a new object instance from another similar instance and then modify according to our requirements.</p>
                        <p><b>The Singleton Pattern:</b> Ensures that only one instance of a class is instantiated. All references to objects of a singlton class refer back to the same instance.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Method:</b> A method is a container for a group of commands that perform one function. A method can be called from another method that needs that particular function performed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Property:</b> The Property Decorator allows you to access a class method as you would a class attribute. No () are needed.

                Licklider was born on March 11, 1915, in St. Louis, Missouri. He studied at Washington University in St. Louis where he graduated with a triple major in physics, mathematics and psychology and went on to his doctorate. He became a research fellow at MIT in 1943 and in 1950 he became interested in information technology. He had ideas about graphical point and click interfaces, digital libraries, e-commerce and online banking. He learned about time-sharing at a conference in Paris, and developed his own version of time-sharing. In 1962 Licklider joined ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) as head of the Information Processing Techniques Office. His work at ARPA included conceiving of and funding network research. While at IPTO, he convinced some of the most important players in the development of the internet, Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and Larry Roberts, that an all-encompassing computer network was very important.
