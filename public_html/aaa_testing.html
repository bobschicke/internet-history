                <div class="sectionText">
                    Unit Testing is a way of testing each part (unit) of the program for proper functionality. Python has a module in its standard library called unittest that contains tools for testing your code.
                    To implement unit testing, you put "test" methods in your project to call and test the "real" methods in your code.
                    The AAA pattern is one way of implementing unit testing.
                    <p>
                        On the Calculator project we have test methods for each of the calculator methods that pass a preset list of values, and then test that the results are correct.

                <h2>What is AAA Pattern?</h2>
                <div class="sectionText">
                    AAA stands for Arrange, Act and Assert.
                    Arrange means to setup the test by creating objects, assigning data to variables, signing into websites or databases, etc.
                    Act means to execute the test which can involve calling methods, passing data or interacting with a website.
                    Assert means to check that the method under test performed the operations correctly.
                    <p>
                    Let's see a simple example:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
                        # This is a function that adds 2 numbers
                        def add(val1, val2):
                            return val1+ val2

                        # This is our test function
                        def test_add():
                            #Arrange
                            value1 = 5
                            value2 = 6
                            #Act
                            result = add(value1, value2)
                            #Assert
                            assert result == 11
                    </code></pre>
                    In the above example the "Arrange" section instantiates variables and assigns values to them. The "Act" section calls the function that we are testing and passes the variables to it and then assigns the return value to result.
                    The "Assert" section checks that the value that was returned e.g. the database values, website status, are what was expected. If they are do not match the expected results then the test will fail.

                    It's important to test often, so you don't get too far down the wrong path. If you code a small section and test it, it will be much easier to debug than if you code for a week and then test it. You should test at least as often as you commit, and it's good to commit a couple times a day. If you follow these practices you will never get too far astray.
