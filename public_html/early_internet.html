                    <p>Small networks had been developed at large businesses and universities, but there was no way to tie them into ARPANET. In 1973 Vint Cerf and Bob Kahnn invented the TCP/IP protocol, which enabled disparate networks to communicate. TCP/IP packets contain the Origination address and the Destination address. The key to this system is the Gateway, which is the computer that connects the smaller networks to the internet.
                        In 1983 TCP/IP was adopted as the international standard.</p>

                    <p>Vint Cerf said that, “The internet is a network of networks”. “The internet is really a design philosophy and architecture expressed in a set of protocols.”
                    A Protocol is a well known set of rules and standards used to communicate between machines.
                    The Internet Protocol, or IP, is a protocol for assigning addresses to computers, basically creating a map of the internet.
                    IPV4 is a 32 bit addressing scheme designed in 1973, adopted in 1980s and is still in use today. Due to the growth of the internet, 32 bits is not enough for a unique address for every computer. Because of this IPV4 is being faded out and IPV6, a 128 bit protocol is taking its place.
                    Due to the fact that using numbers for a computer's address makes it very difficult to remember a website address, they came up with the Domain Name System (DNS) which associates domain names such as google and amazon with the IP address.
                    A website address such as "Https:/pets.com/dogs" is broken down into the following : Protocol:/domain name.Top-Level Domain (TLD)/path
                        Routers monitor paths to the (or towards) the destination IP address and chooses the best path (Time – Politics - Relationships).</p>

                    <p>ARPANET was opened to other R&D sites including universities, research contractors, and government labs.
                    In 1983, the rapidly expanding network broke off from its military part, which became MILNET.
                    NSFNET, operated by the National Science Foundation, replaced ARPANET in 1985
                        ARPANET was finally shut down in February 1990.</p>

                    <p>In 1992 congress passed a bill taking the internet out of the hands of government and making it public.
                    NSFNET continued to operate until 1995, during which time it grew into an important backbone for the emerging Internet.
                    At the same time they formed The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICAAN), which is a non-profit that controls DNS system which registers Domain Names to IP addresses.
                        At that time there were only 50 web pages on the internet. However, Vint Cerf predicted that the internet will be the “telecommunications infrastructure for the 21st century, and will absorb and support all of the other media telephony, television, radio and computer communications.”</p>

                Vint Cerf is and American internet pioneer, who developed the crucial internet protocol TCP/IP alongside Bob Kahn. Cerf wrote the first TCP protocol in 1974 while at UCLA. And then at Stanford he conducted research on packet switching and designed the DoD TCP/IP protocol with Kahn.
                Cerf was highly regarded for his contribution to the internet and received honorary degrees and awards including the National Medal of Tecnology, the Turing award, the presidential Medal of freedom and the Marconi Prize.

                Bob Kahn co-created TCP/IP which is the protocol that the internet is built on. While Kahn was working on the SATNET satellite network project, he got the idea for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) which would later replace the NCP that was used in the ARPANET. TCP was the basis of open-architecture networking, which would be the common language that allowed computers and networks with different hardware and software to communicate across the world.
