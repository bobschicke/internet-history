                        One thing that really captured peoples interest is when they got to participate in the content. Power to the people.
                        Reddit (2005) and more recently Digg (2012) have all content provided by users. Upvotes determine the post's prominence on the site. Users can choose the channels they like and up or downvote
                        Jay Adelson, CEO Digg asks, “Who do you trust more? Do you trust some corporate executive, or do you trust your peers and the people who are connected to you?” Most would trust their peers.

                        Youtube 2005 is a 100% user supplied Video content. Youtube is amazing. It has information about everything you can imagine and all kinds of entertainment.
                        Chad Hurley – CEO and co-founder says, “The internet's about connecting individuals or connecting individuals to information.” “Everyone should have the opportunity to be heard.”

                        Social Networking is about connecting with "friends" and posting personal information to friends and following others personal posts. There is some posting of media and commenting on it, but it's mostly about feeling connected with others.
                        Myspace 2003 was the original social media website and was hugely popular. Facebook followed in 2004 with a similar site and was very popular in colleges. Myspace was overtaken by Facebook in 2009
                        Facebook 2004 – Mark Zuckerberg “The reason you spend so much time communicating with your friends and other people that you respect is because there opinions and what they say means a lot to you.”

                        Blogging is news, opinions and information from one person directly to the audience, and many times there is a two way dialog. Anyone can start a blog on any subject. Some only get a few views, while others become huge successes.

                    The invention of MP3 compression in 1991 made online music practical. With smaller file sizes downloading music was quick.
                    Justin Frankel was the co-creator winamp which was released in 1997. It became a very popular music player whose popularity rose with the rise in mp3 proliferation.

                        Shawn Fanning created a music sharing network website called Napster. Napster allowed users to share music files in blatant disregard of the music copyright laws. Musicians and Record labels were losing millions of dollars to illegal music distribution, but it was very hard to do anything to stop it. The internet was a relatively new technology and the laws hadn't yet caught up.
                        In 2000 one of the bands, Metalica, met with Napster to try to get them to stop trading Metalica songs, but it didn't phase Fanning, and Metalica ended up getting bad publicity over it.

                        In 2001 Hilary Rosen and the RIIA filed a lawsuit against Napster which had profound implications for the role of copyrite in the digital age. The verdict said Napster must be shut down immediately.
                        This was great timing for Apple which introduced iTunes in 2001 with songs for $0.99. Itunes became a huge success for both Mac and Windows users.

                With all the personal information, financial information, intellectual property and critical control systems information that was flying around the internet, security became a huge concern.
                In 1975 Whitfield Diffie introduced the public key concept to encryption. In 1991 Phil Zimmerman created a public key encryption for the computer. This meant that finally it was easy to send messages and files over the internet securely.
                <p>
                    In 1995 a major breakthrough in internet security was the Secure Communication (HTTPS). HTTPS uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt the data. SSL was first developed by Netscape in 1995 for the purpose of ensuring privacy, authentication, and data integrity in Internet communications.
                    A new and better encryption application, Transport Layer Security (TLS), replaced SSL in 1999. Now whenever you go to a sight that uses HTTPS your browser shows a lock icon in front of the URL. When you see this lock you know that your data is secure.

                Musicians just wanted to get paid for their work. I don't think that's too much to ask. But when Metalica asked, Napster said NO.
