                    Bob Taylor – ARPA – 1966 – Wanted to build a network among the 3 computers across the country that he had to work with so that he could communicate with all 3 with one terminal.  In 1969 he was allotted $1 million for the ARPANET project to make it work.
                    Larry Roberts was recruited by Bob Taylor to manage the project. Larry had built the first network between 2 computers at MIT.
                    They decided on using small computers to connect the big computers to the network (Interface Message Processor – IMP). And they used packet switching technology.
                    BBN built the IMPs.
                    <p>By 1969 they had the IMPs working and the IMP software "mostly" working. But they had reached the deadline and had to test the system. They did a basic test of sending one packet between 2 computers on the ARPANET and it worked! ARPANET launched the world's first successful packet-switched wide area computer network.
                    By the end of 1969 they had all 4 computers sending packets across the network.</p>
                    <p>They could send packets across the ARPANET, but there was no practical use for the ARPANET until in December, 1970, Dr. Steve Crocker completed the Network Control Protocol (NCP). The NCP was the original host-to-host protocol for the ARPANET. With NPC they could now send useful information such as files and data across the network.
                    By 1971 the ARPAnet had 18 mainframe computers across the country.</p>

                    <p>Even with 18 sites on the ARPANET, there weren't many users on the system. There was no other use for ARPANET other than sending and receiving data files to analyze.</p>
                    <p>This changed in 1971 when Raymond Tomlinson developed the first "killer" app, email. He came up with the idea to send message files to people on other host computers using the @ sign to separate the persons name and the host computer name. Email was something that everyone could use, and it was a great way to quickly get information back and forth. The Internet Hall of Fame says that, "Tomlinson's email program brought about a complete revolution, fundamentally changing the way people communicate".</p>

                    <p>In October, 1972 ARPA sponsored the first International Conference on Computers and Communication in Washingtion, DC. The purpose of this conference was to showcase the capabilities of the ARPANET. A Terminal Interface Processor was installed at the hotel, connected with a special telephone connection from AT&T. Connected to the Terminal Interface Processor were dozens of terminals spread around the conference hall.</p>
                    <p>The demontration allowed the paticipants to interact with romote computer systems which included an air traffic control system and playing computer chess.
                        The ICCC was a huge success. Before the end of 1972 there were 37 computers on the network.</p>
