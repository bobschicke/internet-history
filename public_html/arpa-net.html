                    Bob Taylor – ARPA – 1966 – Wanted to build a network among the 3 computers across the country that he had to work with so that he could communicate with all 3 with one terminal.  In 1969 he was allotted $1 million for the ARPANET project to make it work.
                    Larry Roberts was recruited by Bob Taylor to manage the project. Larry had built the first network between 2 computers at MIT.
                    They decided on using small computers to connect the big computers to the network (Interface Message Processor – IMP). And they used packet switching technology.
                    BBN built the IMPs.
                    <p>By 1969 they had the IMPs working and the IMP software "mostly" working. But they had reached the deadline and had to test the system. They did a basic test of sending one packet between 2 computers on the ARPANET and it worked! ARPANET launched the world's first successful packet-switched wide area computer network.
                    By the end of 1969 they had all 4 computers sending packets across the network.</p>
                    <p>But there was no practical use for the ARPANET until in December, 1970, Dr. Steve Crocker completed the Network Control Protocol (NCP), which was the original host-to-host protocol for the ARPANET. With NPC they could send files and data across the network.
                    By 1971 the ARPAnet had 18 mainframe computers across the country.</p>

                    <p>Even with 18 sites on the ARPANET, there weren't many users on the system. There was no other use for ARPANET other than sending and receiving data files to analyze.</p>
                    <p>This changed in 1971 when Raymond Tomlinson developed the first "killer" app, email. He came up with the idea to use the @ sign to separate the persons name and the host computer. Email was something that everyone could use, and it was a great way to quickly get information back and forth. The Internet Hall of Fame says that, "Tomlinson's email program brought about a complete revolution, fundamentally changing the way people communicate".</p>
                    <p>In October, 1972 ARPA sponsored the first International Conference on Computers and Communication in Washingtion, DC. The purpose of this conference was to showcase the capabilities of the ARPANET. A Terminal Interface Processor was installed at the hotel, connected with a special telephone connection from AT&T. Connected to the Terminal Interface Processor were dozens of terminals spread around the conference hall.</p>
                    <p>The demontration allowed the paticipants to interact with romote computer systems which included an air traffic control system and playing computer chess.
                       The ICCC was a huge success. Before the end of 1972 there were 37 computers on the network.</p>

                    <p>Around the same time Paul Baran – a researcher at RAND, took on the task of designing a "survivable" communications system. He conceived of a robust communications network using “redundancy” and “digital” technology. Paul invented packet switching techniques that played a key role in the development of the internet.</p>

                Licklider was born on March 11, 1915, in St. Louis, Missouri. He studied at Washington University in St. Louis where he graduated with a triple major in physics, mathematics and psychology and went on to his doctorate. He became a research fellow at MIT in 1943 and in 1950 he became interested in information technology. He had ideas about graphical point and click interfaces, digital libraries, e-commerce and online banking. He learned about time-sharing at a conference in Paris, and developed his own version of time-sharing. In 1962 Licklider joined ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) as head of the Information Processing Techniques Office. His work at ARPA included conceiving of and funding network research. While at IPTO, he convinced some of the most important players in the development of the internet, Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and Larry Roberts, that an all-encompassing computer network was very important.

                In the early 1980s, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded national supercomputing centers at several universities in the United States, and provided interconnectivity in 1986 with the NSFNET project, thus creating network access to these supercomputer sites for research and academic organizations in the United States. International connections to NSFNET, the emergence of architecture such as the Domain Name System, and the adoption of TCP/IP internationally on existing networks marked the beginnings of the Internet.
